          "Last year, I supported the team working on a native Calendar experience in Slack as a product design lead. Calendar aims to integrate all your tools & data into a single, unified layer that allows you to manage all the things competing for your time, right in Slack. I contributed several elements of the visual design, like event details, week view, hover details, and more. I also led the vision work, mapped a year-long roadmap, and partnered across teams to define what an integrated, third party experience in Calendar could look like. We wanted the experience to feel powerful, and playful — true to Slack's personality and product value."

Lists is a simple data management tool designed for project management: things like task tracking, inbound requests, and project updates. I contributed elements of the core experience, like the item detail view, and automations, like the ability to embed and submit forms directly in a channel. I also designed the onboarding and launch experience, using the old system I designed. And, I led design on a net new initiative, called To Dos. Lists wasn't built with personal task tracking in mind, so I adapted a complex, abstract system while keeping the experience intuitive and consistent across the platform."

Plus, our first quality-of-life drop of the last two years! I worked on adding new reactjis, timers, improvements to hand raising, and more. Still keeping a simple, easy to use experience, but also allowing more powerful meetings for those who need it."

To upsell features, I designed contextual nudges that showed up naturally in the user journey. Instead of aggressive coach marks, we focused on helpful, well-timed prompts, followed by banners providing context and instruction. Last but not least, we created playful and lightweight success states to greet a user after a completed interaction. It's highly modular — you can mix and match any of these components in any form to create an educational experience that works for your team, and your feature. I'm proud of what we shipped; our designers, and our users, love it."
