          "This work was completed while staffed on Slack's Zero to One product team as a product design lead. From 2024 to 2025, our team worked to design a native Calendar experience in Slack. Calendar aims to integrate all your tools & data into a single, unified layer that allows you to manage all the things competing for your time, right in Slack. I contributed several elements of the visual design, and led design strategy to create an overall vision for the project. We wanted the experience to feel powerful, and playful â€” true to Slack's personality and product value. This work is currently in progress, and set to GA next year."
